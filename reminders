# Original Plan:

### Project: Digital Graffiti Wall

Create a graffiti-style drawing app where users can:

Draw freehand using different brush styles.
Add text with various fonts and styles.
Insert images and modify them.
Use gradients, shadows, and transparency for effects.
Create cutout effects for unique designs.
How It Uses Your Learned Methods
✅ Shapes & Drawing

fillRect(), strokeRect(), rect() → Background elements, UI panels.
beginPath(), moveTo(), lineTo() → Freehand drawing tool.
setLineDash(), lineDashOffset() → Dashed brush effects.
arc(), arcTo() → Circular spray paint effects.
quadraticCurveTo(), bezierCurveTo() → Smooth curves in drawing.
✅ Styling & Effects

lineWidth, lineJoin → Brush thickness & smooth corners.
globalAlpha → Transparency for layering spray effects.
createLinearGradient(), createRadialGradient() → Colorful paint effects.
createPattern() → Custom brush patterns (e.g., brick or spray dots).
shadows → 3D text or glowing effects.
✅ Text & Fonts

fillText(), strokeText() → Custom graffiti text.
font styling → Bold, italic, fancy fonts.
✅ Images & Cutouts

drawImage() → Import and slice images for graffiti stickers.
clearRect() → Erase portions like a real spray wall.
"Holes in shapes" → Cutout effects in text and patterns.

Extra Features to Try
Spray Paint Effect: Use arc() with random dots inside for a cool spray effect.
Eraser Tool: Use globalCompositeOperation = 'destination-out' to erase like a real spray can.
Save Artwork: Use canvas.toDataURL() to download the graffiti.
